# Xare

Xare is an integration framework build on top of vert.x. Currently, it is in the very early stages with only very few EIPs implemented.

Xare allows routes to be deployed as Vert.x worker verticals, thus running as micro-services, completely independently of one another. The key advantage is that routes can be added, removed and edited on the fly, without downtime and without affecting the rest of the system.
